// DESCRIPTION:
// This extension adds an extra "Clipboard" option to the normal file upload page,
// so you can upload images to MediaWiki directly from the clipboard.
// SUPA applet is used for that (http://supa.sourceforge.net/)
// REQUIREMENTS: PHP 5, MediaWiki 1.17, Java on client machines.
// INSTALLATION:
// 1) Make sure that you either don't have PHP Suhosin extension installed,
//    or that suhosin.post.max_value_length AND suhosin.request.max_value_length
//    settings are enough to pass screenshots. They are 65000 by default on stock Suhosin,
//    and 1000000 (i.e. 1 decimal megabyte) on Debian's Suhosin, which is too low to pass
//    through large images.
//    This is required because SUPA images are uploaded not as "file" parts, but as
//    "normal" POST values. This is a sort of the hack, but other ways to integrate
//    SUPA with normal MediaWiki file upload form are much more tricky.
// 2) If you install SupaMW on MediaWiki 1.24 or later, modify includes/upload/UploadBase.php
//    by changing 'private static $uploadHandlers' to 'public static $uploadHandlers'.
// 3) Put the following into your LocalSettings.php:
//    require_once "$IP/extensions/SupaMW/SupaMW.php";
